minifyRegistered
================================================================================

Collect the registered javascripts and css files and minify them by minify
(https://github.com/mrclay/minify)
for the MODX Evolution content management framework

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this plugin all js and css files added by the MODX API functions `regClientStartupScript`, `regClientScript`, `regClientCSS`, `regClientStartupHTMLBlock` and `regClientHTMLBlock` are checked to minify them by minify

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Upload all files into the new folder *assets/plugins/minifyregistered*
2. Create a new plugin called minifyRegistered with the following code
```
include(MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/plugins/minifyregistered/minifyRegistered.plugin.php');
```
3. Check the event `OnWebPagePrerender` in the plugin configuration (Note 1).

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The plugin has to work before the Quick Manager+ Plugin (if you want to use Quick Manager+). Edit Plugin Execution Order and drag minifyRegistered plugin before Quick Manager+
2. Grouping all registered javascripts in `assets/js` could change the inclusion order of the registered javascripts.
3. Not minified files are included later than the grouped minified and minified files.
4. Registered chunks (i.e. javascript code) are included at the last position of head/body.
5. The order of inclusion is *external*, *grouped minified*, *minified*, *not minified* and direct code.
6. The Plugin needs a working installation of minify (https://github.com/mrclay/minify) in the folder /min in the webroot (the path could be changed in plugin configuration).

Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. the media attribute of the link tag is not used
