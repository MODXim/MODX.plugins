TreeSelect
=========
This plugin can be used to display one or more folder trees in the manager 
backend of MODX Evolution and make files and/or folders selectable by the user.
The selected folder or file is then displayed in the input field of a 
template variable (TV) as a path to the file or folder.

As you can see in the configuration file "configs/default.config.inc.php",
there are many options for a custom configuration and file filtering.
The visual styles can be set in the "TreeSelect.styles.css" and the templates 
in the configuration file(s).
