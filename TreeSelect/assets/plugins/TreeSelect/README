================================================================================
TreeSelectTV plugin 0.2.1
================================================================================
for the MODX Evolution content management framework

================================================================================
Description:
================================================================================

This plugin can be used to display one or more folder trees in the manager 
backend of MODX Evolution and make files and/or folders selectable by the user.
The selected folder or file is then displayed in the input field of a 
template variable (TV) as a path to the file or folder.

As you can see in the configuration file "configs/default.config.inc.php",
there are many options for a custom configuration and file filtering.
The visual styles can be set in the "TreeSelect.styles.css" and the templates 
in the configuration file(s).


Important for upgrades from version 0.1.*:
    The configuration files are not compatible and have to be readjusted


================================================================================
Installation:
================================================================================

1.  Download the archive file and unzip/untar it into a local directiory.


2.  Create a new folder "assets/plugins/TreeSelect" in the MODx-installation 
    directory and copy the following files into it:

        TreeSelect.class.php
        TreeSelect.core.php
        TreeSelect.class.js
        TreeSelect.styles.css
        PluginConfig.class.php
        configs/default.config.inc.php

    (Alternatively you can use a custom name for the new plugin folder and put
    it in the "pluginPath" field of the plugin configuration.)


3.  Set up the plugin:

    Create a new plugin in the manager backend of MODx:
    
    a.  In the "General" tab
        use these values

            "Plugin name":  TreeSelect
            "Description":  <strong>0.2.1</strong> TreeSelectTV plugin 

        Open the file

            plugin.TreeSelect.php

        in a texteditor and copy the content of this file as the "Plugin code"
        into the new plugin.

    b.  In the "Configuration" tab
        insert the following line as "Plugin configuration":

            &pluginPath=Plugin path;string;assets/plugins/TreeSelect/ &tvids=TV IDs;string; &tplids=Template IDs;string; &roles=Roles;string; &input_status=Inputfield status;list;hide,show,toggle;hide &list_separator=Separator;string;/ &list_depth=Tree depth;int;-1 &list_sortBy=Sort by;list;unsorted,name,size;name &list_sortDirection=Sort direction;list;lower -> upper,upper -> lower;lower -> upper &list_sortFirst=Sort first;list;not set,folders,files;folders &list_hideOnSelect=Hide on select;list;yes,no;no &list_image_view=Image preview;list;yes,no;yes &list_path_base=Path base;list;Start folder,Website base,Server root;Start folder &list_folders_base=Base folder (leave empty for MODX base path);string; &list_folders_start=Start folder;string; &list_folders_filter=Folders to ignore (reg. expr.);string;^\.+ &list_folders_accept=Folders to accept (reg. expr.);string;.* &list_folders_showSize=Show folder sizes;list;yes,no;yes &list_folders_only=Folders only;list;yes,no;no &list_files_filter=Files to ignore;string;^\.+ &list_files_accept=Files to accept;string;.* &list_files_showSize=Show file sizes;list;yes,no;yes &list_files_skip_0b=Skip empty files;list;yes,no;no &list_files_maxsize=Max. filesize;int;-1 &list_files_minsize=Min. filesize;int;-1 &list_sizeDecimals=Number of decimals to display;int;2 &list_files_only=Files only;list;yes,no;no

    c.  In the "System Events" tab
        Activate

            "OnDocFormRender" and "OnBeforeDocFormSave".


4.  Create one or more template variables of the type Text and make it usable
    with the template(s) of your site.


================================================================================
Configuration
================================================================================

A.  For
      · the default settings or
      · the use of only one TV with this plugin or
      · more than one TV but with the same tree for all used TVs (comma 
        separated list of ids),

    use the "Plugin configuration" in the manager backend to adjust the
    values.

    The settings are documented in the "configs/default.config.inc.php".

B.  For at least two TVs with different trees, there are (additionally to step A)
    two possibilities to create custom configuration files:

    1st possibility (the easier one):

        MODx manager backend (for administrators only)

        ·   With a click on the "CONFIG" button on the left side of the treelist
            tv in then manager backend, the button expands and shows 3 three
            input fields:
                - Name of the tv configuration
                - option list
                - checkbox

        ·   With a click on the name of the tv configuration a configuration
            window pops up, where the changes can be made

        ·   If the configuration file for the tv does not exist yet, the option
            list offers only the "Save" option. If the configuration file 
            already exists, it displays the options "Reset" and "Delete"

        ·   If the checkbox is checked, the changes will be saved by saving the
            resource.


    2nd possibility:

        Creating configuration files manually

        ·   Make a copy of the file "default.config.inc.php" inside the
            "configs/" folder.

        ·   Rename it to "*.config.inc.php" (where * should be replaced by a
            name of your choice, e.g. "tv23.config.inc.php").

        ·   Edit the file and set the correct values in there.

        ·   Make sure it is placed in the folder "configs/".

    Inside the new file you may delete the lines (and comments) you don't
    need, except of the first and the last line.

To make the plugin usable, at least you have to adjust the ids of the
template variables (created in step 4) in the plugin's configuration
backend or/and the custom configuration file(s).

The id numbers of the TVs and templates are displayed in round brackets in
the template- and tv-listing of the manager backend right after the names.


Example file structure for the plugin folder:

MODX-base-path/
    assets/
        plugins/
            TreeSelect/
                TreeSelect.class.js
                TreeSelect.class.php
                TreeSelect.core.php
                TreeSelect.styles.css
                configs/
                    default.config.inc.php
                    tv23.config.inc.php
                    treetv.config.inc.php
                    anothertree.config.inc.php
