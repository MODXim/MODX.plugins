2. Open the "plugin.markdown.tpl" file and copy all its contents.
3. Create a new plugin in the Manager (Resources > Manage Resources > Plugins >> New plugin).
4. Paste the code in the source field.
5. In the "System Events" tab, enable the "OnWebPagePrerender" Template Service Event.

* How to use *

- Make sure WYSIWYG editors (such as FCKEditor) are disabled.
- Enclose all your Markdown stuff inside <markdown> </markdown> tags. (You can put these tags in a template to simplify the process.)
- That's it!
